There is simple WPF app that get systen information from WinApi:   
Win32_Processor;   
Win32_BIOS;  
Win32_BaseBoard;  
Win32_VideoController;  
Win32_DiskDrive;  
Win32_NetworkAdapter;  

In the result we have hashed Hardware ID for any other manipulations, like check it on server side and logging in.
